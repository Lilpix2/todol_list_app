# todol_list_app
 A To do list program to help with my anxiety, made with the help of open AI Python
 The goal of this project is to learn how to code with the help of AI

 Currently the to do list has a basic interface
 I want it to hold a bunch of items but only to reveal the highest priority up to a set number of items
